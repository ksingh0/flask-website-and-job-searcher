# Flask Website and Job Searcher

Designed a personal website with Python using Flask for the back end and Bootstrap/HTML for the front end. 

Includes a webapp that takes a user input and scrapes data from Indeed to display info on related jobs with links to the posting and uses Pandas to sort them into a table.
